About me
Hey there! 👋🏼

I'm Beatriz, a chemical engineer 👩🏻‍🔬 with an insatiable appetite for learning. 
I've successfully obtained the ISTQB - Foundation Level certification and am now embarking on an exciting career shift into the tech world. 👩🏻‍💻 
Why? Because I'm passionate about the dynamic opportunities it offers. 🚀

I'm your go-to tech enthusiast: self-motivated, highly organized, and always ready for a challenge. Fast-paced and innovation-driven environments? I thrive in them!

When I'm not immersed in the world of quality assurance, you'll find me absorbed in books 📖, crafting words ✍🏻, or indulging my love for sports 🏋🏻‍♀️. I'm all about striking a balance—balancing creativity and determination to reach my goals.

I can't wait to further advance my career while collaborating with some tech-savvy individuals. My motivation? It's all about making a positive impact in the tech universe and sharing a few laughs along the way. Let's connect and work some tech magic together! 🪄😄
